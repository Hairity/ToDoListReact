# To-Do List made with React

Good 'ol to-do list but with react not vanilla js. I made this to practice my hooks and to-do list was easy and simple. Nothng fancy but does it's work. 
Also has a filter option for completed and uncompleted to filter through tasks.

What I learned: React, Hooks(useState and useEffect) and how to save and get from local storage.
